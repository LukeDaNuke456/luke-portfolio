### Background

Hello! I'm Luke, a Computer Science graduate from the University of Arkansas with about 4 years of experience.
After obtaining my degree, I began my career as a software engineer in the retail industry, where I discovered my
passion for building innovative solutions
that meet clients' needs and drive business success.

I currently work at Gateway Apps and have previously worked at Dillard's Inc. and Field Agent. At Dillard's, I built backend
services for data retrieval, cleaned up databases, refactored code for scalability, and wrote automated tests for
Spring Boot and Angular applications. At Field Agent, I helped develop the Plum Marketplace and built a web scraping tool using
Django and Vue.js.

In my free time, I enjoy golfing, shotgun sports, and working on personal coding projects.
