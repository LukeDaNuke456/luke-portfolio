## Background

Hello! I'm Luke, and I'm currently writing this introduction in markdown format to be inserted into my website. This is my way of sharing a bit about myself.

I am a passionate Software Engineer with experience in backend development, system optimization, and automating complex processes to improve performance and scalability. I currently work at Gateway Apps and previously worked with Dillard's Inc. and Field Agent, where I developed solutions to enhance efficiency, reduce technical debt, and improve system functionality.

At Dillard's Inc., I designed backend services for dynamic data retrieval, implemented processes to clean up databases, and refactored codebases for better scalability. I also wrote automated tests to ensure the reliability of Spring Boot and Angular applications, while authoring detailed documentation that improved team collaboration and project efficiency.

During my time at Field Agent, I contributed to the development of the Plum Marketplace and built a web scraping tool using Django and Vue.js to improve site performance. My work also included optimizing application speed through better utilization of CPU cores.

I am deeply committed to writing clean, maintainable code, automating tasks, and ensuring systems are both efficient and secure. My experience spans Java, Python, Spring Boot, Angular, Django, Vue.js, and SQL, and I continuously look for opportunities to improve my skills while contributing to innovative projects.
